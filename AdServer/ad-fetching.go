/*
This file will contain methods needed to fetch ads from panel,
together with its metadata from PostgreSQL database.

The result will be written to a `map` structure that maps a pair of (ad-id, publisher-id)
to a pair of (impression count, CTR).


IN THE FOLLOWING, A DEMO OF THE FUNCTIONALITIES
IMPLEMENTED IN THIS FILE IS DESCRIBED


* When fetching ads from panel:
	* fetch ad success statistics from metadata database
	* compute the CTR per publisher of every ad
		A SELECT statement --> map[ad-id][publisher-id] -> (impression, ctr)
		A SELECT statement --> map[advertiser-id] -> mean CTR
	* if an ad is not displayed on this publisher yet, set CTR to the average CTR of ads of its advertiser
		for on fetched-ad, publisher: if map[ad][publisher] = null: map[ad][publisher] = (0, mean CTR of advertiser)
	* compute the revenue expected value by taking the product of CTR and bid, for each ad
		expected[ad-id][publisher-id] = bid[ad-id]  * prob[ad-id][publisher-id]
	* compute the tolerance range for each ad
		algorithm described below
	* select the ad with maximum expected value, together with ads that can 'beat' that ad as a result of tolerance.
		---
	* compute the relative weights of those selected ads
		weight[ad-id][publisher-id] = expected[ad-id][publisher-id] / NORMALIZATION_TERM
* When a publisher requests for a new ad:
	* draw a random weighted ad, encrypt and send.
		Maybe using the uniform distribution?


* Confidence interval (95%):

** METHOD ONE: ADDITION-BASED
P (d <= e) > 1 - 2exp(-2e^2N) >= 0.95
-2e^2N <= ln(0.025)
N >=  ln(40)/(2e^2) ~= 1.8444 / e^2
e^2 >= ln(40)/(2N)
e >= sqrt(ln(40) / 2)  /  sqrt(N) ~= 1.36 / sqrt(N)
upper bound: CTR + 1.36 / sqrt(N)
lower bound: CTR - 1.36 / sqrt(N)

** METHOD TWO: MULTIPLICATION-BASED
upper bound: CTR * a
lower bound: CTR / a
